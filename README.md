Remix of Prusa Research RC2 face shield to improve protection, ergonomics, and production efficiency

This is a remix of the Prusa RC2/RC3 face shield redesigned to provide better lateral protection, print faster, and be compatible with easier to make shield pieces.

After consultation with numerous healthcare professionals, the consensus was that, while they very much appreciated the RC2/RC3 shields, there were still some significant improvements that could be made with regard to both vertical and horizontal protection. This design has been iterated with their feedback to fill that need. I also made some modifications to reduce print time & material usage while maintaining comfort, to make the elastic band adjustable to fit multiple head sizes. and to make the shield frame compatible with shield pieces that can be made using a standard adjustable 3 hole punch.

This shield frame is designed to accept  a .010" - .020" thick PETG sheet with an overall size of 13" x 8.5" (the smaller dimension is variable). To punch the holes, I bought and used this adjustable 3 hole punch:

But any adjustable 3 hole punch should work fine. For my holes, I removed the third punch entirely, moved the left punch to the leftmost "3 Hole" setting, and moved the middle punch to the leftmost "2 Hole" setting (pictures of this are above). To make the holes, just put the plastic in, punch one side of holes, and then flip it over and punch the other side. After that, assembly is the same as the Prusa model other than that for RC4 the elastic needs to be routed through the ends (picture also included above).

For those who don't have this hole punch but still want to use this design, I've included engineering drawings of the shield hole dimensions in both metric and imperial. You can use either a 1/4" or 9/32" hole punch.
